## Installation

### Option 1: Run from Source (Development)

1. Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed on your system
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python ping_tool.py
   ```

### Option 2: Build Executable (Deployment)

1. Install build dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r build_requirements.txt
   ```

2. Build the executable:
   ```bash
   .\build.bat
   ```
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name "NetworkDiagnosticTool" ping_tool.py
   ```

3. The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory
4. Copy the executable to target Windows machines

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**: Double-click `NetworkDiagnosticTool.exe` or run `python ping_tool.py`

2. **Enter Target**: 
   - Type an IP address (e.g., `8.8.8.8`) or hostname (e.g., `google.com`)
   - The application validates input format automatically

3. **Configure Ping**: Select the number of ping packets (1, 4, 8, 10, or ‚àû for unlimited)

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Click **üîç Ping Test** to perform a ping test
   - Click **üõ§Ô∏è Traceroute** to trace the network path
   - Use **‚èπÔ∏è Stop** to cancel running operations
   - Use **üóëÔ∏è Clear Results** to clear the output

5. **View Results**: Results are displayed in real-time in the scrollable text area

## System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11
- **Python**: 3.7+ (for source version)
- **Memory**: 50MB RAM
- **Network**: Internet connection for external tests

## Technical Details

- **Language**: Python 3.7+
- **GUI Framework**: tkinter (built-in)
- **Packaging**: PyInstaller
- **Threading**: Multi-threaded for responsive UI
- **Network Commands**: Uses Windows `ping` and `tracert` commands

## Network Commands Used

- **Ping**: `ping -n [count] [target]` or `ping -t [target]` for unlimited
- **Traceroute**: `tracert [target]`

## Deployment Notes

- The application runs without requiring administrator privileges
- All network operations use standard Windows commands
- Results are displayed in real-time with proper error handling
- The executable is self-contained and portable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Another operation is already running"**
   - Wait for the current operation to complete or click Stop

2. **"Invalid IP address or hostname format"**
   - Check the format of your input
   - Valid examples: `192.168.1.1`, `google.com`, `8.8.8.8`

3. **Ping/Traceroute fails**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the target is reachable
   - Some networks may block ICMP packets

### Build Issues

If you encounter issues building the executable:

1. Ensure PyInstaller is properly installed
2. Try running as administrator during build
3. Check that all Python dependencies are available
